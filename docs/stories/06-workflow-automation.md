- Users can monitor workflow execution status
- Users can pause and resume workflows

## Technical Details
- Implement workflow definition UI in React
- Create workflow engine with task queue processing
- Set up workflow execution monitoring
- Add conditional logic support for workflows
- Implement workflow step types (data fetch, transform, email, API call)
- Store workflow configurations in PostgreSQL database
