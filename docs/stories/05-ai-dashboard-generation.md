# User Story: AI Dashboard Generation

## Overview
As a user, I want the AI to automatically generate dashboard layouts based on my data and requirements so that I can quickly create meaningful visualizations without manual configuration.

## Roo Mode Orchestration
**Architect Mode**: Designs the AI dashboard generation system architecture including prompt engineering, data processing pipelines, and integration with backend services
**Designer Mode**: Uses the UI generation grammar to conceptualize and create beautiful dashboard layouts with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
**Code Mode**: Implements AI-powered dashboard generation logic and layout algorithms

## Implementation Approach
1. Create AI prompt templates for dashboard generation requests
2. Implement layout recommendation algorithms based on data types
3. Design beautiful, responsive dashboard templates using the grammar system
4. Build component mapping from AI suggestions to shadcn/ui elements
5. Add user customization options after AI generation
6. Implement feedback loops for improving AI recommendations
7. Create stunning visualizations that follow modern design principles

## Technical Details
- Use the internal grammar system to translate AI concepts into layout structures
- Map AI-generated layouts to shadcn/ui components (card, grid, flex, etc.)
- Apply Tailwind CSS for consistent styling and responsive behavior
- Integrate with lucide-react icons for visual enhancement
- Use React Query for managing AI generation state and results
- Implement toast notifications for AI generation feedback
- Add proper error handling for failed AI generation attempts

## Success Criteria
- AI can generate meaningful dashboard layouts from user requests
- Generated layouts are responsive and visually appealing
- Users can customize AI-generated dashboards
- Generation process is fast and efficient
- Layouts follow modern UI/UX design principles
- Error handling provides clear feedback when generation fails
